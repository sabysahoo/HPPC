\begin{abstract}
This semester research project investigates the potential speedups and scalability of running a traffic simulation in parallel using C++ and OpenMP. These speedups are evaluated by comparing the sequential performance to the parallel performance when varying thread counts for a fixed-size, randomized input. While a large percentage of the program is inherently sequential due to computation, the process of transitioning from one state to another was parallelized.
